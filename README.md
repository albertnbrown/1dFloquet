StandardTransferMatrix.ipynb:
This file is the simplest file that creates and displays data. Commented to explain most of the steps.

1-D Chiral Evolution ED.ipynb:
Directly simulates the evolution of the system. Commented for first time use.

1DUnitaryTMatrix.ipynb:
The file I used for most of the visualizations in my thesis. Contains all the alternative models we tested within the same class as the original one as well as the theoretical toy model that shows the basest action necessary for this type of behavior.

The images in this folder are examples of data generations from the code. In the subfolder, I have diagrams from my thesis showing the action of the model.
